# 30 Days of React

So, me and few of my friends decided to learn react from <a  href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React">this repo.</a> And it all began. So, I stared reading the contents written by <a  href="https://github.com/Asabeneh">Asabeneh</a>, and did his exercises almost regularly. This website contains all the exercises I've done. Press the top right button on Navbar to navigate between them. Things I skipped were writing down questions like: "What is JSX?", "What is React?", "How do you do this?", "What is props?", "Write a function to print this array", "Go study, you f\*cking idiot" blah...blah....blah. I mean who tf writes them down like a high school student racing with his teacher's speech so that he doesn't miss a word xD

Anyway, there are some topics, for example: day 3, day 4 and day 5, where the exercises are to build same components using different methods like using functional component, class component or JSX, etc. So, in case of these types of exercises, I've skipped down to using just a single method. But still, you'll find it on all days coz I've linked them all to single work.

Also, if you are good at using react, and by any chance, get to stroll this repo, I am a complete noob xD. I don't know much about the standard react coding and template guide. So, you can create an issue...which will help me learn from my mistakes. Anyway, Seeya (^\_^)

P.S: Most of my codes are responsive. And also some code still needs to be commented and formatted properly. So, bear with it for now.

## This is the end of my message. Below are the instructions to run this repo on your local machine I guess

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
